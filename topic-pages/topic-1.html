                    <h2>A Brief History of the Web Browser</h2>
                    <p>
                        Web browsers are essential tools that have shaped how we interact with the World Wide Web. Ultimately, browsers allow us to adapt to new technologies as they develop. We see this in how its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, who also invented the Web, created it to harness the power of the Internet as a means to share documents and other resources.

                        <h3>The origins of the Web and the First Browser (1989–1990)</h3>
                        Tim Berners-Lee, while working at CERN, developed the first web browser as part of the Web’s fundamental technologies: HTML, URI (today: URL), and HTTP. At the time, the browser functioned as a client-side interface, allowing users to access and display documents from servers across the facility.
                        <h3>Rise of More Advanced Browsers (Mid-1990s)</h3>
                        With the increased processing power of newer computers, web browsers were able to support more advanced technologies. Such fundamentals as Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript made for dynamic and interactive web pages we all enjoy today. As a result, more complex websites also gave rise to more intricate and versatile Web-related activity. These included: e-commerce, email, more effective search engines, and, as has proven itself today, online education. Moreover, as these new technologies developed, the complexity of the Web called for more cohesive Web development standards. When utilized, the World Wide Web became platform-independent as browsers now supported the same Web standards.
                        <h3>Web 2.0 and the Continued Evolution of Browsers (Mid-2000s and Later)</h3>
                        The development of the Web 2.0–a concept introduced in 2004 defining the second generation of the World Wide Web–presented a shift in the workings of Internet society, as more users generated and shared content on platforms like blogs, wikis, and social networking sites. So too did the advent of the smartphone, alongside other mobile devices, send browsers to smaller screens. Thus, the new landscape of now ubiquitous handheld computers shifted the Web into a mobile design (which could not have happened without the continued development of the Web browser).
                        <h3>To Infinity and Beyond</h3>
                        Looking toward the future, modern browsers persist in their evolution building on the essential technologies they started with. As the world invents new forms of information technology, the browser is sure to develop in tandem with it.
