                    <p>The Web operates as a client-server architecture. For most users, the Web browser serves as the client.</p>

                    <p>The client-server model (Wikipedia).</p>
                    <h3>What is the Client-Server Model?</h3>
                    <p>The client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between service (or resource) providers and the clients, who request those services (Wikipedia). This communication usually carried out through a computer network on separate hardware; however, it is possible to run both the client and server on the same device (Wikipedia).</p>
                    <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
                    <p>The Web browser serves as the mechanism with which users access and navigate the Web. Over a computer network, the browser, which is the client, requests a resource, likely a website or hosted file, from a server. In this instance, computational resources are not shared by the client; instead, the server houses the necessary program to handle the client’s request (Wikipedia). This server program handles all the processing involved in retrieving and responding to the client, and when the server’s response has been received by the client browser, the browser renders the document for display on the user’s computer. Among many things, this document could be a website, such as this one!</p>
                    <h3>Considering the Implications of the Client-Server Model</h3>
                    <p>The client-server architecture of the Web allows device users to access (or “browse”) the great wealth of information stored digitally and scattered across the globe. As the name suggests, the model facilitates the resource requests of the user, who seeks to fulfill many tasks, such as: email, printing, and–of course–surfing the World Wide Web, among other things (Wikipedia).</p>
