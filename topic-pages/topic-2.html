                        The Web operates as a client-server architecture. For most users, the Web browser
                         serves as the client.

                                The client-server model is a distributed application structure that
                                 partitions tasks or workloads between service (or resource) providers
                                  and the clients who request those services. This communication is
                                   usually carried out through a computer network on separate hardware;
                                    however, it is possible to run both the client and server on the
                                     same device. Fundamental in modern networking, the client-server
                                      model allows devices and applications to interact with each other
                                       over networks like the Internet. In the context of the World Wide
                                        Web, a web browser often functions as the client side of the
                                         client-server model. Without this model, there would be no
                                          practical way for the millions of users who now use the
                                           Internet to access the Web.

                                For the client-server model to facilitate web browsing, there must be a
                                 web server to which the client (the browser) makes requests. Typically,
                                  a web server will deliver such content as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                                   clients, and a web browser acting as the client will be responsible
                                    for requesting these resources and rendering them if they are
                                     received. When a request is made to a server, the request is
                                      processed either through the querying of databases or the
                                       processing of transmitted data, and then the proper content is
                                        sent back to the browser to be displayed.
                                <br><br>
                                Communication through the client-server model occurs via a
                                 request-response format. First, the client (in this case, a web
                                  browser) sends a request to the server for resources like web pages or
                                   other documents. Afterwards, the server processes the request and
                                    submits a response. Such an operation often utilizes protocol
                                     standards like the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure
                                      variant, HTTPS, allowing for seamless communication with various
                                       systems–even those across the globe.
                                <br><br>
                                Naturally, the response-request format is a core feature of interactions on
                                  the World Wide Web. For example, a user might enter a URL into his or
                                   her browser’s search bar. When the user returns this URL in the bar,
                                    the browser (acting as the client) submits an HTTP request to the
                                     server, which then processes the request and sends the retrieved
                                      data (as an HTTP response) back to the browser. Since this
                                       interaction occurs incredibly fast, web browsing thus becomes an
                                        efficient activity.

                                With regard to web development, the terms “client-side” and “server-side”
                                 refer to where the processing of information takes place. Notably,
                                  interactions that occur on the client-side occur on the user’s web
                                   browser and include actions like the rendering of documents and web
                                    pages, which themselves include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among
                                     other things, and images and embedded content like video players
                                      and news feeds that may furthermore request data from another web
                                       server. On the other hand, interactions that occur on the
                                        server-side occur on a web server usually at some undisclosed
                                         location. Such actions done on the server-side may include the
                                          processing of form data or the generation of dynamic content
                                           in response to what the client has requested.
                                <br><br>
                                As mentioned, most modern browser and user interactions in the
                                 client-server model will take place through the HyperText Transfer
                                  Protocol (HTTP), which is used to communicate between the client and
                                   the server. The secure version of HTTP is called “HyperText Transfer
                                    Protocol Secure” and it encrypts the data that is transmitted
                                     between the client and server to protect the user’s privacy and
                                      prevent other users from listening in on any data being sent.
                                       Without it, users sending sensitive data like passwords or
                                        banking information could become the victims of a cyber-attack
                                         or identity theft, among other things. Ultimately, the HTTP and
                                          HTTPS protocols structure the way in which data is transmitted
                                           and received across the Internet, ensuring that data is
                                            transmitted reliably on the Web; and with this in mind,
                                             modern web browsers may ensure that a website supporting
                                              HTTPS is visited as opposed to the basic HTTP. Otherwise,
                                               the browser may issue a warning about entering sensitive
                                                information on the site.

                                The client-server model is a fundamental technology for operating the
                                 World Wide Web. As has been described, the model structures a way for
                                  clients, like web browsers, to communicate with servers and access and
                                   navigate information over the Internet. Via a request-response cycle,
                                    alongside protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, users can retrieve and
                                     interact with web content both efficiently and securely in a matter
                                      of seconds.
